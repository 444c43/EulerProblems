# Project Euler

A C# solution to solving problems at [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/)

*Project Goals:*

+ Solve first five Euler problems using a console solution
+ Continuously improve the OOP solution (refactoring as I go)
+ Transfer solution to WinForms (GUI) interface
+ Refactor for user input (variability of problems--ranges, etc,...)
+ Convert to ruby programming solution
+ Convert to rails solution
+ Continue to add Euler solutions

*Currently solved problems:*

+ Multiple of 3 and 5
+ Even Fibonnaci number
